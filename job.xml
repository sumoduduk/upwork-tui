I have this storyboard from my client that I need animated and exported as an SVG.<br /><br />

There are two animations on there.<br /><br />
Animation 1 - I need the envelope to flip around, one hand grabs it, hands it to the other and the fists bump together.<br /><br />
Animation 2 - Envelope wiggles and bursts with shapes and then closes it again.<br /><br />
I can do this animation in After Effects but I can&#039;t export to svg.<br /><br />
In your reply can you send a rough estimate of hours and also do you have a rough guess of how big the svg file size would be?<br /><br />
I will need this within the next 7 days.<br /><br />

These must be authentic tasks, not staged videos. Therefore, we require a videographer capable of capturing genuine workers.<br /><br />
The videos should have a non-professional appearance, giving the impression that they were filmed by the workers themselves, perhaps using a phone placed somewhere or held in one hand. They should be recorded on a phone without any film effects or stabilizers. Additionally, these videos could include some handy work tips or life hacks, such as the correct method for cutting wooden corners or replacing a section of old flooring. The video should be engaging and attention-grabbing.<br /><br />
No editing or color correction is necessary, and it&#039;s preferred for the original sound of the work to be captured.<br /><br />
Each video should be between 15-30 seconds (preferably longer rather than shorter). it could be speeded up to show the whole process.<br /><br />
